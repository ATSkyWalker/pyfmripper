PyFMRipper
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

PyFMRipper is a set of scripts written in Python that can do the following:
  - Establish a session with the Last.fm servers
  - Tune into artist channels (e.g. Music Like Pink Floyd)
  - Write to disk the playlist tracks
  - Insert ID3 tags into the saved files using the information in the playlist
  
  
These scripts were created out of my own fascination with the platform and love
for music. Usage of these scripts maybe illegal in some countries! 


I am not a Python developer by any stretch of the imagination, but I picked it up
about 2 years ago and wanted to brush up on it a bit and this little project was
an excuse for doing just that.

The program has some reusable classes and a "driver" which uses them to tune in,
save to disk, and tag the files. Putting the files into iTunes and requesting it
to download album art usually does the trick unless the track is of some obscure 
origin or a limited release album.


DISCLAIMER:
This is an initial release and works well enough to scratch my own itch. If it, 
for some obscure reason, becomes popular I'll try to tie the loose ends and have 
better error checking :).


CREDITS:
This could not have been possible if it wasn't for the awesome documentation done 
by the folks behind TheLastRipper [http://thelastripper.com/] and 
[http://code.google.com/p/thelastripper/]. The work done in these scripts is completely
based on documentation found at: http://code.google.com/p/thelastripper/wiki/LastFM12UnofficialDocumentation

Thanks Guys!
